Minimal-Bitcoin-Miner
=====================

A very simple CPU based Bitcoin Miner in C#. Uses the GETWORK protocol to connect to pool. A great reference implementation if you are trying to understand how Bitcoin mining works.

<b>Edit 2017: Not actually fit for mining - the GETWORK protocol isn't supported anymore by most pools</b>
